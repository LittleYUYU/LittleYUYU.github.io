Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/">Department of Computer Science at George Mason University</a>, where I co-lead the <a href="https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/">George Mason NLP group</a>. I am also affiliated with <a href="https://c4i.gmu.edu/">C4I & Cyber Center</a>, <a href="https://cahmp.gmu.edu/">Center for Advancing Human-Machine Partnership</a>, and <a href="https://idia.gmu.edu/">Institute for Digital InnovAtion</a> at GMU. I received my PhD degree from <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University (OSU)</a> in 2021. I have spent time interning at Microsoft Semantic Machines, Carnegie Mellon University, Microsoft Research, Fujitsu Lab of America, and Tsinghua University. I work in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), particularly building natural language interfaces (e.g., question answering and dialogue systems) that can reliably assist humans in knowledge acquisition and task completion.  Some specific topics include:
<ul>
  <li><i>Language and code:</i> I am interested in studying the interplay between natural language and programming language, including semantic parsing or general-purpose code generation, program-aid language understanding, NLP for Software Engineering applications, etc.</li>
  <li><i>Human-AI interaction:</i> I explore how machine learning systems can proactively collaborate with and learn from humans during decision making, as demonstrated in the setting of "interactive semantic parsing" (our multi-year effort: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08195.pdf">ACL'23</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=v9hAX77--cZ">ICLR'21</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00689.pdf">EMNLP'20</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05389.pdf">EMNLP'19</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06740.pdf">AAAI'19</a>). </li>
  <li><i>Question Answering:</i> This includes tasks such as machine reading comprehension or broad QA tasks over heterogenous data sources.</li>
  <li><i>Efficient NLP/AI for X:</i> I study building machine learning models with limited supervision, especially for low-resource domains (e.g., healthcare).</li>
</ul>
