Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/">Department of Computer Science at George Mason University</a>, where I co-lead the <a href="https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/">George Mason NLP group</a>. I am also affiliated with <a href="https://c4i.gmu.edu/">C4I & Cyber Center</a>, <a href="https://cahmp.gmu.edu/">Center for Advancing Human-Machine Partnership</a>, and <a href="https://idia.gmu.edu/">Institute for Digital InnovAtion</a> at GMU. I received my PhD degree from <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University (OSU)</a> in 2021. I have spent time interning at Microsoft Semantic Machines, Carnegie Mellon University, Microsoft Research, Fujitsu Lab of America, and Tsinghua University. I work in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), particularly building natural language interfaces (e.g., question answering and dialogue systems) that can reliably assist humans in knowledge acquisition and task completion.  My interested topics include:
<ul>
  <li><b>Reasoning, Planning, and Knowledge Grounding</b>: we advance NLP/AI systems (including Large Language Models/LLMs) in various tasks demanding reasoning, planning, and knowledge grounding. Exemplar tasks include <b>Text-to-Code Generation</b> (e.g., co-organized <a href="https://nlp4prog.github.io/2021/">workshop on NLP for Programming at ACL'21</a>), <b>motion planning</b> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03249.pdf">ICLR'24W</a>), and <b>Information Extraction</b> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13469.pdf">EMNLP'23</a>). 
  
  With my wonderful collaborators, we recently built <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04030.pdf">Gentopia</a>, an open-source platform for implementing <b>Tool-Augmented LLM Agents</b>, to facilitate the exploration of LLMs for reasoning and planning.</li>

  <li><b>Responsible and trustworthy natural language interfaces</b>, where we study how language interfaces can be made more trustable and responsible in their interaction with humans. This includes topics of: 
  
  (1) <b>Human-AI interactive framework</b>, represented by our multi-year effort in "interactive semantic parsing" -- <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08195.pdf">ACL'23</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=v9hAX77--cZ">ICLR'21</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00689.pdf">EMNLP'20</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05389.pdf">EMNLP'19</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06740.pdf">AAAI'19</a>;
  
  (2) <b>Enhancing accessibility to LLMs</b>, represented by our recent effort in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03094.pdf">saving the monetary cost of calling LLM APIs</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02107.pdf">optimizing user prompts to LLMs for task efficacy and safety</a>.
  
  (3) <b>Model interpretability</b>: I am broadly interested approaches to understanding NLP/AI models, especially LLMs. Our prior effort includes <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13820.pdf">explaining LLMs for code generation post hoc</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17378.pdf">understanding their tokenization effect</a>.
  </li>

  <li><b>Interdisciplinary Applications</b>: I'm passionate about making real impacts of NLP/AI to critical domains and applications. Our recent effort includes building <a href="https://murongyue.github.io/MathVC.github.io/">Multi-LLM Agents for Mathematics Education</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03646.pdf">a Foundation Model for Network Communication</a>, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10869-022-09864-6?sharing_token=oM_FITa-ZMsaUxDt1dypj_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6dkXYeEYupPSqR009uRLqzjOkoEQXE54xAk8giN9qKGscoSEQcHEIuAsVuTIH0Y85EB05c3M1eR5mnsr203HjI_mcaqkcI_jvDvKGUfa1q1FviAXgPeTPBhW3gDGiJNqo=">GPT3 for personality test generation in I/O Psychology</a>. </li>

</ul>
