Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/">Department of Computer Science at George Mason University</a>, where I co-lead the <a href="https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/">George Mason NLP group</a>. I am also affiliated with <a href="https://c4i.gmu.edu/">C4I & Cyber Center</a>, <a href="https://cahmp.gmu.edu/">Center for Advancing Human-Machine Partnership</a>, and <a href="https://idia.gmu.edu/">Institute for Digital InnovAtion</a> at GMU. I received my PhD degree from <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University (OSU)</a> in 2021, and have spent time interning at Microsoft Semantic Machines, Carnegie Mellon University, Microsoft Research, Fujitsu Lab of America, and Tsinghua University. I work in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). My research has been founded by <b>National Science Foundation</b>, <b>Microsoft Accelerate Foundation Models Research Award</b>, <b>Virginia Commonwealth Cyber Initiative</b>, and <b>UMD's Applied Research Laboratory for Intelligence and Security</b>. I was the <a href="https://2024.naacl.org/committees/organization/#diversity--inclusion-chairs">Diversity & Inclusion Co-Chair at NAACL 2024</a> and the lead faculty organizer of <a href="https://www.mascsll.org/2023/">MASC-SLL 2023</a> (a local NLP event with a 10-year history in the Mid-Atlantic area). I co-organized <a href="https://suki-workshop.github.io/">SUKI at NAACL 2022</a> and <a href="https://nlp4prog.github.io/2021/">NLP4Prog at ACL 2021</a>.

My interested topics include:
<ul>
  <li><b>Knowledge Grounding, Reasoning, and Planning</b>: we advance NLP/AI systems (including Large Language Models/LLMs) in various tasks demanding knowledge grounding, reasoning, and planning. Exemplar tasks include <a href="https://nlp4prog.github.io/2021/">code generation</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03864">math reasoning</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18711">motion planning</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16377">information extraction</a>. 
  </li>
  
  <!-- With my wonderful collaborators, we recently built <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04030.pdf">Gentopia</a>, an open-source platform for implementing <b>Tool-Augmented LLM Agents</b>, to facilitate the exploration of LLMs for reasoning and planning.</li> -->

  <li><b>Responsible and trustworthy natural language interfaces</b>, where we study how language interfaces can be made more trustable and responsible in their interaction with humans. This includes topics of: 

  (1) <b>Model interpretability</b>: Check out our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02646">task-centric survey on Mechanistic Interpretability</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12288">interpretation of CoT via neuron activation in LLMs</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18499">mechanistic interpretaion of LLMs in syntactic code completion</a>;
  
  (2) <b>Human-AI interactive framework</b>, represented by our multi-year effort in "interactive semantic parsing/code generation" -- <a href="https://hyan5.github.io/IntelliExplain/">Preprint'24</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08195.pdf">ACL'23</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=v9hAX77--cZ">ICLR'21</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00689.pdf">EMNLP'20</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05389.pdf">EMNLP'19</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06740.pdf">AAAI'19</a>;
  
  (3) <b>Enhancing accessibility to LLMs</b>, represented by our recent effort in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03094.pdf">saving the monetary cost of calling LLM APIs</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02107.pdf">optimizing user prompts to LLMs for task efficacy and safety</a>.
  
  </li>

  <li><b>Interdisciplinary Applications</b>: I'm passionate about making real impacts of NLP/AI to critical domains and applications. Our recent effort includes building <a href="https://murongyue.github.io/MathVC.github.io/">Multi-LLM Agents for Mathematics Education</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03646.pdf">a Foundation Model for Network Communication</a>, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10869-022-09864-6?sharing_token=oM_FITa-ZMsaUxDt1dypj_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6dkXYeEYupPSqR009uRLqzjOkoEQXE54xAk8giN9qKGscoSEQcHEIuAsVuTIH0Y85EB05c3M1eR5mnsr203HjI_mcaqkcI_jvDvKGUfa1q1FviAXgPeTPBhW3gDGiJNqo=">GPT3 for personality test generation in I/O Psychology</a>. </li>
