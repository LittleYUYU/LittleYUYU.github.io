Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/">Department of Computer Science at George Mason University</a>, where I co-lead the <a href="https://nlp.cs.gmu.edu/">George Mason NLP group</a>. I am also affiliated with <a href="https://c4i.gmu.edu/">C4I & Cyber Center</a>, <a href="https://cahmp.gmu.edu/">Center for Advancing Human-Machine Partnership</a>, and <a href="https://idia.gmu.edu/">Institute for Digital InnovAtion</a> at GMU. I received my PhD degree from <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University (OSU)</a> in 2021. I have spent time interning at Microsoft Semantic Machines, Carnegie Mellon University, Microsoft Research, Fujitsu Lab of America, and Tsinghua University. I work in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), particularly building natural language interfaces (e.g., question answering and dialogue systems) that can reliably assist humans in knowledge acquisition and task completion.  Some specific topics include:
<ul>
  <li><i>Language and code:</i> I am interested in studying the interplay between natural language and programming language, including semantic parsing or general-purpose code generation, program-aid language modeling, NLP for <a href="https://nlp4prog.github.io/2021/">AI4SE/Programming</a>, etc.</li>
  <li><i>Human-AI interaction:</i> I explore how machine learning systems can proactively collaborate with and learn from humans during decision making, as demonstrated in the setting of "interactive semantic parsing" (our multi-year effort: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08195.pdf">ACL'23</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=v9hAX77--cZ">ICLR'21</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00689.pdf">EMNLP'20</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05389.pdf">EMNLP'19</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06740.pdf">AAAI'19</a>). </li>
  <!-- <li><i>Question Answering:</i> This includes tasks such as machine reading comprehension or broad QA tasks over heterogenous data sources.</li>
  <li><i>Efficient NLP/AI for X:</i> I study building machine learning models with limited supervision, especially for low-resource domains (e.g., healthcare).</li> -->
  <li><i>Information Intelligence with LLMs:</i> I also study improving information intelligence tasks (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08926.pdf">question answering</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13469.pdf">information extraction</a>) in the age of Large Language Models (LLMs), covering problems such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05966.pdf">knowledge grounding</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/Gentopia">tool augmentation</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13820.pdf">interpretability</a>, and many others.</li>
</ul>

:star2: Excited to launch <a href="https://github.com/Gentopia-AI/Gentopia">Gentopia-AI</a>, an open-source platform for creating, evaluating, and community-sharing <b>Augmented Language Model (ALM)-based Agents</b>! Check out our [teams](https://gentopia-ai.github.io/Gentopia-AI-Homepage/#about) with researchers and engineers from NC State, UMich/PennState, George Mason, CMU, etc. Stay tuned and join us! (_Update Oct 2023: Gentopia has been accepted to EMNLP'23 Demo!_)
