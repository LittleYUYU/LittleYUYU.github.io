:gem: Grateful to receive a 3-year grant from National Science Foundation (NSF) on fostering the mathematical modeling competencies of middle-school students by leveraging the power of Generative AI/LLMs (see <a href="https://murongyue.github.io/MathVC.github.io/">our prototype here</a>)! My first lead-PI NSF project ever;) I'm very lucky to make it with the wonderful <a href="https://drjennifersuh.onmason.com/">Jennifer Suh</a> from GMU Math Edu and <a href="https://zjanice.github.io/">Janice Zhang</a> from William & Mary CS!
